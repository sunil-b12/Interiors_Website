                            put them all together into the perfect design for us.
                            She also helped to get us on the same page with interior 
                            design, taking parts of things I like and other things my 
                            wife likes and finding the perfect compromise...‚Äù

                            Michelle was very accommodating and worked around our schedule.
                             She definitely helped us create our dream home all while staying in our budget. 
                             It seemed she was just as excited about our house as we were and she made sure to fit in
                             everything that was on my wish list. I have already started to refer my friends and family to 
                             this company! Thank you Avant Desyn.
